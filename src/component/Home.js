                          <h3>  The Concept of Wheel of Life </h3> 
              <p> The Wheel of Life is a simple yet profound metaphor illustrating how different areas of life need to be in alignment for you to move forward smoothly. </p>

<p> Much like how a wheel needs all its spokes to be even for it to roll without bumps, every aspect of life—career, health, relationships, finances, personal growth, and more—needs attention and nurturing to create a balanced, fulfilling existence. </p>

<p>When one area is neglected or underdeveloped, the “wheel” becomes uneven, causing life to feel stuck, frustrating, or off-track. This tool highlights the importance of achieving balance, where each area is attended to in a way that promotes continuous forward movement. </p>
                            </div>
    
                <div className="how" style={{marginBottom:"40px"}}>
               <h3> How It Works</h3>
<p> The Wheel is typically a circle divided into segments representing different areas of life. </p>

<p>Individuals rate each segment on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 representing dissatisfaction and 10 representing peak fulfillment. </p>

<p>Once the ratings are plotted on the wheel, the result is a web-like pattern that provides a clear overview of balanced or imbalanced areas.</p>
                </div>

            <div className="purpose" style={{marginBottom:"40px"}}>
           <h3> Purpose and Benefits </h3>
<li>  Holistic View: It helps individuals see which parts of their life are thriving and which need improvement. </li>
<li>  Identify Imbalances: Gaps in the wheel point to areas requiring more focus to achieve a sense of balance. </li>
<li>  Prioritize Action: Once weak areas are identified, users can create goals to bring those areas closer to satisfaction. </li>
<li>  Visual Motivation: Seeing progress visually encourages further effort and highlights successes. </li>
            </div>

            <div className="align" style={{marginBottom:"40px"}} ref={scrollRef}>
           <h3> Aligning Your Wheel, Living Your Best Life </h3>
<p>The concept of the Wheel of Life underscores that balance isn't static; it requires ongoing attention and adjustments. Life is dynamic, and priorities will shift over time. </p>

<p>By regularly auditing your wheel, you can prevent burnout, foster sustainable growth, and keep rolling toward fulfillment and success without constantly hitting roadblocks. </p>

<p>Remember, when every part of the wheel is aligned, life flows with less resistance—making the journey smoother, more enjoyable, and ultimately more successful </p>
